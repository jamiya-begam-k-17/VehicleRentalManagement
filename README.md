# ðŸš— Vehicle Rental Management System

Welcome to my **Vehicle Rental Management** project!

This is a full-stack application built for a 15-day app development course, where users can book vehicles (cars or bikes) for a certain period. Admins can manage vehicles, bookings, and users efficiently.
